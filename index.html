        <h1>Saint Gwydion the Ruthless, The Arrogate in Anima, Saint of the Axe</h1>
        <p>Much of the history of Marcester and Saint Gwydion the Ruthless is one and the same&mdash;or at least, they are intertwined to the point that it is difficult to distinguish one from another.</p>
        <p>This story begins with an upstart nobleman, one Æthelrod Anforþ, heads north from Myntire. His reasons for doing so vary depending on the teller of the story: Some say that the man was simply bored and looking for purpose, as many are wont to do at that age; others believe that a grand purpose drove him. Others still whisper that he was banished, and that he set out to conquer an area of his own with steel in hand. A gifted speaker, Æthelrod gathered a sizable group of followers and strove northward, settling in the ruins of an ancient city north of Carmonborough and west of the burgeoning fief of Llundarfel. Farms were set up, and all manner of fortune-seekers travelled in the direction of Æthelrod's escapade.</p>
        <p>However, as Æthelrod had crossed the Aian wall, crossing into the borderlands, it did not take long afore the settlement was beset by Lundrian raiders. With timely aid from the Argent Staff, an adventuring company, the raiders were repelled. King Oman II invested Æthelrod with the title of margrave for the accomplishment; this was the founding of Marcester.</p>
        <p>Yet the following years brought more raiders, and so the margrave began amassing an army to strike northward. Among them Gwydion of the house of Llowarch, a third child who took little joy in courtly politics. Joining the army as an officer with the cavalry.</p>
        <p>The Wastes hold more than trickery and boogeymen, however. In their midst the urq revered the Eternal Tree; a beacon on the horizon of Marcester, a massive tree said to hold the soul of Aulus Didius, the last emperor of the Logand-preceding empire. Sealed there, body succumbed to poison, mind sustained by the self-sacrificing magic of the Empire's last loyal mage. Over five centuries since the fall of the empire, the Eternal Tree remained; the legacy of a world-spanning reign.</p>
        <p>Yet the urq are crafty, and their knowledge is unlike that of normal men. They maimed the Tree, redirected its wrath: Leaving the Marcester army was stranded in a torrent of rain and mud. As the urq closed in, Gwydion rallied a band of like-minded cavalerists and broke through the urq line, reaching the Eternal Tree with Lundrian raiders in close pursuit. As his men bought him time, Gwydion cut down the Eternal Tree, knowing the legends. He was struck down in retribution, but the torrents ceased; and though the margrave had perished to the urmen, Saint Gwydion appeared to guide the survivors back to the walls of Marcester.</p>
        <p>Almost two centuries afterwards, the Saint Gwydion remains a symbol of safety and authority in Marcester and surrounding acres. Though the Church of Gwydion in southern fiefdoms is almost nonexistent, it has an official capacity in Marcester, running the city guard and keeping order. Service is held once each week, at market day; teachings are spread as allegoric stories. The Church is close to a state religion; emphasis is put on an orderly society, and the difficult choices that must be made to maintain it.</p>
